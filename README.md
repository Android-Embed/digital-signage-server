======================

The SAPO Digital Signage Server v2.0, Codebits 2014 Edition

## Context:

This is the server we used to run our digital signage solution during [Codebits 2014][cb].

It was used to schedule hundreds of assets (including live data and video streams) across roughly 20 wide screen LCDs, wall projectors, etc. during the 3 days of the event, using [a custom built Android client][ac].

This repository contains (almost) all the source code we used, except for a private API to [MEO Kanal][mk] - nevertheless, you should be able to tweak it to get it running without the missing bits.

In case you can't or are just curious about what it looked like, here's a screenshot we took during the event, with most of the assets loaded:

Managing assets and moving them between playlists is done entirey via drag-and-drop, using a Kanban component [Hugo Lima](https://github.com/hmiguellima) developed for the [Ink][ink] library (we'll be releasing that component as part of a single page application framework we're also working on).

## Next Steps

As to future developments, the `mqtt` branch contains a reboot of this solution to use [MQTT][mqtt] instead of HTTP polling in an attempt to provide real-time synchronization of multiple displays and integration with other hardware devices (such as lighting and projection controllers based on Arduino).
